Sorting Algorithms are concepts that every competitive programmer must know. Sorting algorithms can be used for collections of numbers, strings, characters, or a structure of any of these types.

Bubble sort is based on the idea of repeatedly comparing pairs of adjacent elements and then swapping their positions if they exist in the wrong order.

Bubble Sort 
You have been given an array A of size N . you need to sort this array non-decreasing oder using bubble sort. However, you do not need to print the sorted array . You just need to print the number of swaps required to sort this array using bubble sort

Input Format

The first line consists of a single integer N denoting size of the array. The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

# Write your code here
def bubble(n,arr):
    c=0
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(n-1-i):
            if arr[j]>arr[j+1]:
                tmp = arr[j+1]
                arr[j+1]=arr[j]
                arr[j]=tmp
                c+=1
    return c

# Write your code here
n = int(input())
li = list(map(int,input().split()))
print(bubble(n,li))
